# lab-scheduler
This is a program i wrote to make a scheduler for laboratories / workshops that will have a lot of groups of students coming in and doing classes within these laboratories / workshops

This program is written using the C programming language,and was originally written by Anthony Ivan Sunardi and Rahmad Nurcahya
.This program was originally made for a final project for an undergraduate class about algorithms and programming

Things that this program lacks:

1.No user interface, only runs using a command prompt/terminal

2.No database usage

3.Has to be run continuously or the data recorded will be lost

4.Code descriptions and variables are written in Bahasa Indonesia, and not english

Feel free to add to this program, and also let me know if you want to make a big project from this, would love to help
and also contribute
